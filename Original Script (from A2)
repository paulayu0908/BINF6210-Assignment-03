#Part C - Investigation of the Community Phylogenetic Structure of Cigaritis in Different Coutries    

#Research Introduction: Cigaritis is a genus of butterflies in the family Lycaenidae. Its species are found in Africa, Indonesia, Malaysia and adjacent regions of Asia. However, the community phylogenetic structure of Cigaritis is still unclear. This research aims to investigate the community phylogenetic structure of Cigaritis by measuring levels of phylogenetic diversity (PD) in selected countries. The phylogenetic diversity measure was designed to be a potential indicator for  the relative feature diversity of different subsets of species from a phylogeny. In this research, an R package called 'picante' will be used to calculate the PD of each country as the minimum total length of all the phylogenetic branches required to connect all those species within a subset on the tree. 

#Step 1: Retrieve Original Data and Format the Data for the Study: 

Cigaritis.BOLD <- read_tsv("http://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/API_Public/combined?taxon=Cigaritis&format=tsv")
Cigaritis.BOLD.nuccore.for.alignment <- DNAStringSet(Cigaritis.BOLD$nucleotides)
Cigaritis.BOLD <- Cigaritis.BOLD %>% 
  mutate(Combined_Name=paste(Cigaritis.BOLD$processid,Cigaritis.BOLD$species_name))
class(Cigaritis.BOLD$nucleotides)

#Step 2:  Align Sequence from Data 

Cigaritis.BOLD.alignment <- DNAStringSet(muscle::muscle(Cigaritis.BOLD.nuccore.for.alignment, gapopen=-3000, gapextend=-400, maxiters = 8, diags1 = TRUE))   #typo in argument: gapopen not gapopenning, gapextend not gapextension; also not sure for diags1 argument because may reduce accuracy; Even though the max iteration set as 8, but the muscle alignment stop at iteration 3.
names(Cigaritis.BOLD.alignment) <- Cigaritis.BOLD$Combined_Name

#Step 3: Cluster Aligned Sequence into OTUs 
dnaBin.Cigaritis <- as.DNAbin(Cigaritis.BOLD.alignment)
Cigaritis.distanceMatrix <- dist.dna(dnaBin.Cigaritis,model = "TN93",as.matrix = TRUE, pairwise.deletion = TRUE)
Cigaritis.OTUs <- IdClusters(Cigaritis.distanceMatrix,
                                  method = "NJ",
                                  cutoff= 0.03,
                                  showPlot = TRUE,
                                  type = "both",
                                  verbose = TRUE)

#Please find the dendrogram in the pdf file. 


#Step 4: Select one sequence per OTU (for building the phylogeny)
Cigaritis.OTUs.List<-Cigaritis.OTUs[[1]]

#Comment: use tibble to contruct this data frame with simple column name
#a simple column name can reduce the error in downstream analysis
Cigaritis.BOLD.clean <- tibble (processid = Cigaritis.BOLD$processid,     
                               species_name = Cigaritis.BOLD$species_name,  
                               markercode = Cigaritis.BOLD$markercode,
                               nucleotides = Cigaritis.BOLD$nucleotides,
                               cluster = Cigaritis.OTUs.List$cluster,
                               country = Cigaritis.BOLD$country)

Cigaritis.one.per.cluster<-Cigaritis.BOLD.clean %>% 
  group_by(Cigaritis.BOLD.clean$cluster) %>% 
  sample_n(1)

#Step 5: Align the Representative Sequences
Cigaritis.one.per.cluster$nucleotides <- DNAStringSet(Cigaritis.one.per.cluster$nucleotides)
Cigaritis.OTUs.Alignment <- DNAStringSet(muscle::muscle(Cigaritis.one.per.cluster$nucleotides, gapopen=-3000,gapextend=-400,maxiters = 8, diags1 = TRUE)) #same mistake
names(Cigaritis.OTUs.Alignment) <- Cigaritis.one.per.cluster$species_name

#Step 6: Build the Phylogeny 
Cigaritis.OTU.DNAStr <- as(Cigaritis.OTUs.Alignment, "DNAStringSet")
writeXStringSet(Cigaritis.OTU.DNAStr, file="Cigaritis_OTU_alignment.fasta")
Cigaritis.Phylo <- read.phyDat("Cigaritis_OTU_alignment.fasta",format="fasta",type="DNA")
Cigaritis.OTU.DM <- dist.ml(Cigaritis.Phylo)
Cigaritis_Tree_0 <- (ape::nj(Cigaritis.OTU.DM))    

#Comments:
#only use distance based method to build phylogeny tree is potential inaccurate
#maxmium likelyhood may be a better choice 

Cigaritis_Tree_0$tip.label[15] <- c("Cigaritis larseni_1")
names(Cigaritis.Phylo) <- Cigaritis_Tree_0$tip.label
fit.ini <- pml(Cigaritis_Tree_0, Cigaritis.Phylo, k=4)  #create the inital tree for optimization
fit <- optim.pml(fit.ini, optNni=TRUE, optBf=TRUE,
                 optQ=TRUE, optGamma=TRUE)      #select what we want to optimize: tree topology, base frequencies, the rates of all possible subtitutions and use a gamma distribution to model variation in the substitution rates across sites 

Cigaritis_Tree <- fit$tree
Cigaritis_Tree$tip.label[15] <- c("Cigaritis larseni") #restore the original name

Cigaritis_Tree <- nnls.tree(Cigaritis.OTU.DM, Cigaritis_Tree, rooted = TRUE)
#Step 7: Annotate species with corresponding country names 

#Comments: tibble is a subpackage in tidyverse which is aiming to create data frame in a simple way 
head(Cigaritis_Tree$tip.label) 
Tree_Table <- tibble(           
  Tip.lable = Cigaritis_Tree$tip.label
  , Country = Cigaritis.one.per.cluster$country 
)


# I am going to create a function to color the species with respect to their corresponding countries.
ggtree(Cigaritis_Tree) %<+% Tree_Table + #%<+% is a operator in ggtree which can add extra information for tree
  geom_tiplab(aes(color=Country)) +   #add labelled names and assign each name with colour corresponded to their countries
  theme(legend.position = "right") +  
  ggplot2::xlim(0,0.06)    #shrink the size of tree
#Comments: ggtree is a powerful package based on ggplot. It provides freedom and simpilicity in tree visulization. That chunk of codes can be replaced by 5 lines of codes.   

#Please find the annotated phylogeny tree in the pdf file. 

#Step 8: Calculate the phylogenetic diversity of Cigaritis in each country (New Package Exploration: "picante")

Cigaritis.country.by.species <- Cigaritis.BOLD %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  count(species_name)

Comm.Cigaritis<-spread(Cigaritis.country.by.species,species_name,n)
Comm.Cigaritis[is.na(Comm.Cigaritis)]<-0

pd.result <- pd(Comm.Cigaritis,Cigaritis_Tree,include.root = FALSE)
pd.result <- pd.result %>% 
  mutate(region=Comm.Cigaritis$country)
pd.result <- pd.result[,c(3,1,2)]

#Step 11: Visualize the PD Result on World Map (New Package Exploration: "rworldmap")

sPDF <- joinCountryData2Map(pd.result,joinCode = "NAME",nameJoinColumn = "region")
Bubble<-mapBubbles(sPDF,nameZSize = "PD",nameZColour = "region",colourPalette = "rainbow",oceanCol = "white",landCol = "grey",main = "The Distribution of Phylogenetic Diversity by Country")

#Please find the the bubble map in the pdf file. 

#Result Interpretation 
# After calculating the phylogenetic diversity (PD) by country in the present dataset, it is observed that India has the lowest level of PD whereas Malaysia has the highest level of PD. The overall range of PD in the present dataset is from 0.013 to 0.084. Interestingly, South Africa has the greatest species richness while its corresponding PD is 0.043 which is almost 50% less than the PD value of Malaysia. The main reason of relatively lower PD value for South Africa is that the total branch lengths required to connect all the species collected in South Africa is short. Low PD value could indicate that the phylogenetic distance among those species in South Africa is closer than the species in other countries and the species in the chosen country capture only a small portion of the total phylogenetic diversity present in the entire phylogeny.  

#Discussion 
#The varying levels of PD by country are observed in the chosen dataset, indicating the community phylogenetic structures and the extent of species differences in these countries do vary. Also, while conducting phylogenetic diversity analysis, it worths noticing the relationship between species richness and phylogenetic diversity. For example, in the case of South Africa, where higher species richness corresponds to relatively lower PD value, it reflects the reality that the species richness should not be regarded as a predictor of phylogenetic diversity. 

#Knowing areas with higher PD values helps biologists assign conservation priorities for geographical regions. In fact, areas with higher PD should be protected more because those areas contain species that are more taxonomically distinct and represent a greater scope of biological features. The successful protection of those regions with high PD can help retain more evolutionary options for future needs.

#In fact, there are other measures of phylogenetic diversity. For example, originality of species within a set (Pavoine et al., 2005) and Species Evolutionary History (Redding & Mooers, 2006) are both the alternative methods for measuring phylogenetic diversity. After this mini-research, it worths further exploring and comparing the performances of those two methods with the performance with Faith's PD (Faith,1992) in biodiversity estimation for a given dataset.
